# CRT / DRT / GTDoR Theory Repository

This repository contains LaTeX source files for three theoretical frameworks:

- **CRT (Conscious Relativity Theory)**  
- **DRT (Dynamic Relative Theory)**  
- **GTDoR (Generalized Threshold Dynamics of Resilience)**  

The goal is to provide clean, reproducible LaTeX documents with shared references and figures, compiled automatically using GitHub Actions.
